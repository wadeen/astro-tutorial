  <h1>My Astro Learning Blog</h1>
  <p>This is where I will post about my journey learning Astro.</p>

  <p>I am working through Astro's introductory tutorial. This is the second page on my website, and it's the first one I built myself!</p>

  <p>This site will update as I complete more of the tutorial, so keep checking back and see how my journey is going!</p>
